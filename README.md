Details about the project, how did you do it and any other relevant info that would be necessary for evaluators to judge your work.

This project was created as part of the Insaid capstone to help HR Advisories to detect possible employees who may end up quitting the organisation. The data was sourced from HRMS where the details of the past and current employees were being recorded for the past 15 years.

In this project, the outcome is a classification where we judge if the employee is likely to quit or not
